This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch to have a binary classifier for classifying images as either Cats or Dogs. 
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of pet images downloaded from Kaggle and uses common preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization and augmentation. 
The trained model is evaluated using accuracy metrics and visualising performance on test samples.
